# DecisionSupportSystem
An Ensemble Learning-based Method for Clinical Decision Support System in Diabetes Diagnosis using AdaBoost Algorithm

In this project our goal was using an Ensemble Learning method in Clinical Decision Support System. I was familiar with AdaBoost as an Ensemble Learning algorithm and have implemented the algorithm in MATLAB. So we used AdaBoost as algorithm and Pima Indians
Diabetes Data Set as dataset from UCI website. As weak classier for AdaBoost we used KNN and naive bayes and set number of iterations to 5. Also we designed a user interface using
MATLAB software in order to work with ease.
